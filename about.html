        <h3>WHO AM I</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Aniket Dash</strong>. I recently graduated with a degree in Data Science and completed my
          internship with <a href="https://www.cropin.com/" target="_blank">CropIn</a>.</p>
        <p>I've always been drawn to stories, how they map thoughts into existence. My curiosity often lies in seeing
          how separate ideas connect and form a single narrative.</p>
        <p>This instinct for connection shapes how I approach both data and design through patterns, balance, and
          structure.</p>

        <h3>BRIEF HISTORY</h3>

        <h4>Till 2018</h4>
        <p>Born in Sunabeda, Koraput, I wasn't the top of my class, but I was endlessly curious. I played every sport I
          could and learned from motion and rhythm.</p>

        <h4>2019–2021</h4>
        <p>I joined <a href="https://outr.ac.in/" target="_blank">OUTR</a> (formerly CET) to study Applied Physics. Most
          of my time, however, was spent playing guitar in the college band. That's where I truly learned collaboration
          and flow.</p>

        <h4>2021–2025</h4>
        <p>I later joined <a href="https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a> to study Data Science. I
          started from scratch, learning to code, revisiting mathematics, and diving into deep learning.</p>
        <p>The realization that a model's ability to <strong>learn and adapt</strong> is inspired by the human brain
          changed everything for me. My internship at CropIn deepened my interest in <strong>earth observation</strong>,
          working under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravikant-bhargav/" target="_blank">Ravikanta Bhargava</a>
          and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deshwani/" target="_blank">Deshwani E</a> on cloud removal networks
          and contrastive learning methods like SimCLR.</p>

        <h3>CURIOSITY</h3>
        <p>As a child, I had a box full of unused gadgets, speakers, VCRs, radios, and remotes, all of which I'd take
          apart just to see how they worked.</p>
        <p>That habit of deconstructing things to understand their inner workings stayed with me. Today, whether it's a
          model or a product, I still feel the need to break it down, not to destroy it, but to rebuild it better.</p>
        <p>At one point, I even tried to build an arc reactor, because building Iron Man's suit felt like a solid backup
          career plan.</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello ! I am Aniket Dash. I recently graduated with a degree in data science and completed my data science internship with <a href="https://www.cropin.com/">CropIn</a>.</p>
    <p>I have always been in love with stories and how they map thoughts into existence.</p>
    <p>My ability to see connections between ideas allows me to view the world through a unifying lens.</p>

    <h3>Brief History</h3>
    <h4>Till 2018</h4>
    <p>Born in Sunabeda, Koraput, I wasn’t the top of my class, but I was endlessly curious and that helped me stay above water. I was quite good at all kinds of sports and movement.</p>
    <h4>2019-2021</h4>
    <p>After school, I got into <a href="https://outr.ac.in/">OUTR</a>( formerly CET) to study Applied Physics. But I mostly found myself playing guitar in the college band that’s where I spent the majority of my time (and heart).</p>
    <h4>2021-2025</h4>
    <p>I eventually dropped out and joined <a href="https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/">IIT, Madras</a> to study data science. I started to learn to code from scratch, revisited complex mathematics and naturally got gravitated towards deep learning. The realization that a model's ability to <strong>learn and adapt</strong> is inspired from the human brain acted as a catalyst for me to get deeper into it. </p>
    <p>My internship at CropIn was a great experience that allowed me to dive deeper into <strong>earth observation</strong>. With guidance from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravikant-bhargav/">Ravikanta Bhargava</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deshwani/">Deshwani E</a>, I worked on cloud removal networks and contrastive learning methods like SimCLR for crop monitoring.</p>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello, I’m <strong>Aniket Dash</strong>. I recently graduated with a degree in Data Science and completed my internship with <a href="https://www.cropin.com/">CropIn</a>.</p>
      <p>I’ve always been drawn to stories, how they map thoughts into existence. My curiosity often lies in seeing how separate ideas connect and form a single narrative.</p>
      <p>This instinct for connection shapes how I approach both data and design through patterns, balance, and structure.</p>

      <h3>Brief History</h3>

      <h4>Till 2018</h4>
      <p>Born in Sunabeda, Koraput, I wasn’t the top of my class, but I was endlessly curious. I played every sport I could and learned from motion and rhythm.</p>

      <h4>2019–2021</h4>
      <p>I joined <a href="https://outr.ac.in/">OUTR</a> (formerly CET) to study Applied Physics. Most of my time, however, was spent playing guitar in the college band. That’s where I truly learned collaboration and flow.</p>

      <h4>2021–2025</h4>
      <p>I later joined <a href="https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/">IIT Madras</a> to study Data Science. I started from scratch, learning to code, revisiting mathematics, and diving into deep learning.</p>
      <p>The realization that a model’s ability to <strong>learn and adapt</strong> is inspired by the human brain changed everything for me. My internship at CropIn deepened my interest in <strong>earth observation</strong>, working under <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravikant-bhargav/">Ravikanta Bhargava</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deshwani/">Deshwani E</a> on cloud removal networks and contrastive learning methods like SimCLR.</p>

    <section class="curiosity">
      <p>As a child, I had a box full of unused gadgets, speakers, VCRs, radios, and remotes, all of which I’d take apart just to see how they worked.</p>
      <p>That habit of deconstructing things to understand their inner workings stayed with me. Today, whether it’s a model or a product, I still feel the need to break it down, not to destroy it, but to rebuild it better.</p>
      <p>At one point, I even tried to build an arc reactor, because building Iron Man’s suit felt like a solid backup career plan.</p>
